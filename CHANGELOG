== 11.0.0 2017-XX-XX
* We've made some updates to our Apple Pay helper methods. If you're accepting Apple Pay outside the US, be sure to use the methods that accept a country parameter, as a different set of payment networks may be available in your country.

== 10.1.0 2017-05-05
* Adds STPRedirectContext, a helper class for handling redirect sources.
* STPAPIClient now supports tokenizing a PII number and uploading images.
* Updates STPPaymentCardTextField's icons to match Elements on the web. When the card number is invalid, the field will now display an error icon.
* The alignment of the new brand icons has changed to match the new CVC and error icons. If you use these icons via `STPImageLibrary`, you may need to adjust your layout.
* STPPaymentCardTextField's isValid property is now KVO-observable.
* When creating STPSourceParams for a SEPA debit source, address fields are now optional.
* `STPPaymentMethodsViewControllerDelegate` now has a separate `paymentMethodsViewControllerDidCancel:` callback, differentiating from successful method selections. You should make sure to also dismiss the view controller in that callback
* Because collecting some basic data on tokenization helps us detect fraud, we've removed the ability to disable analytics collection using `[Stripe disableAnalytics]`.

== 9.3.0 2017-01-05

  * Note: This will cause navigation bar theming to work properly as described in the Stripe iOS docs, but you may need to audit your custom theme settings if you based them on the actual behavior of 9.0-9.2
* If the navigation bar has a theme different than the view controller's theme, STP view controllers will use the bar's theme to style it's UIBarButtonItems

== 6.0.0 2015-10-19
* Splits logic in STPCard into 2 classes - STPCard and STPCardParams. STPCardParams is for making requests to the Stripe API, while STPCard represents the response (you'll almost certainly want just to replace any usage of STPCard in your app with STPCardParams).
