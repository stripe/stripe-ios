# UI Examples

This example app lets you try out the pre-built UI components we provide.

You can run it without any initial setup and it's a great place to start if you're evaluating whether you want to use our [Standard Integration](/Example/Standard%20Integration/README.md) or build your own [Custom Integration](/Example/Custom%20Integration/README.md).

1. Open `./Stripe.xcworkspace` (not `./Stripe.xcodeproj`) with Xcode
2. Build and run the "UI Examples" scheme
