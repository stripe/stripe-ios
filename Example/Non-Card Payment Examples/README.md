# Non-Card Payment Examples

This example app demonstrates how to use `STPAPIClient` to accept various non-card payment methods. This may be a useful reference if you're building your own payment flow and not using `STPPaymentContext`. For examples of accepting cards, check out [stripe-samples](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-card-payment).

To run this app:

1. If you haven't already, sign up for a [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) (it takes seconds).
2. Open `stripe-ios/Stripe.xcworkspace` (not `stripe-ios/Stripe.xcodeproj`) with Xcode
3. Fill in the `stripePublishableKey` constant in `stripe-ios/Example/Non-Card Payment Examples/Constants.m`  with your Stripe [test "Publishable key"](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys.). This key should start with `pk_test`.
4. Head to [example-mobile-backend](https://github.com/stripe/example-mobile-backend/tree/v18.1.0) and click "Deploy to Heroku". Provide your [Stripe test "Secret key"](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys.) as the `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY` environment variable. This key should start with `sk_test`.
5. Fill in the `backendBaseURL` constant in `Constants.m` with the app URL Heroku provides (e.g. "https://my-example-app.herokuapp.com")

After this is done, you can make test payments through the app and see them in your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments).

Head to https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards for a list of test card numbers.
