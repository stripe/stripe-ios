* `STPPaymentContext`'s `retryLoading` method will now always attempt to retrieve a new customer object, regardless of whether a cached customer object is available. Previously, this method was only intended for recovery from a loading error; if a customer had already been retrieved, `retryLoading` would do nothing. [#863](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/pull/863)
* `STPCustomerContext` has a new property: `includeApplePaySources`. It is turned off by default. [#864](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/pull/864)

If you've implemented a class conforming to `STPBackendAPIAdapter`, you may add implementations of these methods to support deleting cards from a customer and saving shipping info to a customer. [#813](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/pull/813)
* Adds the ability to set custom footers on view controllers managed by the SDK. [#792](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/pull/792)

* We've greatly simplified the integration for `STPPaymentContext`. See MIGRATING.md.
* As part of this new integration, we've added a new class, `STPCustomerContext`, which will automatically prefetch your customer and cache it for a brief interval. We recommend initializing your `STPCustomerContext` before your user enters your checkout flow so their payment methods are loaded in advance. If in addition to using `STPPaymentContext`, you create a separate `STPPaymentMethodsViewController` to let your customer manage their payment methods outside of your checkout flow, you can use the same instance of `STPCustomerContext` for both.
* We've added a `shippingAddress` property to `STPUserInformation`, which you can use to pre-fill your user's shipping information.
* `STPPaymentContext` will now save your user's shipping information to their Stripe customer object. Shipping information will automatically be pre-filled from the customer object for subsequent checkouts.
* Fixes nullability annotation for `[STPFile stringFromPurpose:]`. See MIGRATING.md.
* Adds description implementations to all public models, for easier logging and debugging.

* `paymentRequestWithMerchantIdentifier:` has been deprecated. See MIGRATING.md
* If the card.io framework is present in your app, `STPPaymentContext` and `STPAddCardViewController` will show a "scan card" button.
* `STPAddCardViewController` will now attempt to auto-fill the users city and state from their entered Zip code (United States only)
* Polling for source object updates is deprecated. Check https://stripe.com/docs for the latest best practices on how to integrate with the sources API using webhooks.
* Fixes a crash in `STPCustomerDeserializer` when both data and error are nil.
* `paymentMethodsViewController:didSelectPaymentMethod:` is now optional.
* Updates the example apps to use Alamofire.

* Updates STPPaymentCardTextField's icons to match Elements on the web. When the card number is invalid, the field will now display an error icon.
* The alignment of the new brand icons has changed to match the new CVC and error icons. If you use these icons via `STPImageLibrary`, you may need to adjust your layout.
* STPPaymentCardTextField's isValid property is now KVO-observable.
* When creating STPSourceParams for a SEPA debit source, address fields are now optional.
* `STPPaymentMethodsViewControllerDelegate` now has a separate `paymentMethodsViewControllerDidCancel:` callback, differentiating from successful method selections. You should make sure to also dismiss the view controller in that callback
* Because collecting some basic data on tokenization helps us detect fraud, we've removed the ability to disable analytics collection using `[Stripe disableAnalytics]`.

## 9.3.0 2017-01-05
* Fixes a regression introduced in v9.0.0 in which color in STPTheme is used as the background color for UINavigationBar
  * Note: This will cause navigation bar theming to work properly as described in the Stripe iOS docs, but you may need to audit your custom theme settings if you based them on the actual behavior of 9.0-9.2
* If the navigation bar has a theme different than the view controller's theme, STP view controllers will use the bar's theme to style it's UIBarButtonItems
* Adds a fallback to using main bundle for localized strings lookup if locale is set to a language the SDK doesn't support
