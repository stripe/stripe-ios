 An `STPCustomerContext` retrieves and updates a Stripe customer using
 an ephemeral key, a short-lived API key scoped to a specific customer object.
 If your current user logs out of your app and a new user logs in, be sure to
 either create a new instance of `STPCustomerContext` or clear the current
 instance's cached customer. On your backend, be sure to create and return a

 prefetched customer immediately if its age does not exceed `cachedCustomerMaxAge`.
