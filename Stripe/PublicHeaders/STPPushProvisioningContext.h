/**
 This class makes it easier to implement "Push Provisioning", the process by which an end-user can add a card to their Apple Pay wallet without having to type their number. This process is mediated by an Apple class called `PKAddPaymentPassViewController`; this class will help you implement that class' delegate methods. Note that this flow requires a special entitlement from Apple; for more information please see https://stripe.com/docs/issuing/cards/digital-wallets .

/**
 This is a helper method to generate a PKAddPaymentPassRequestConfiguration that will work with
 Stripe's Issuing APIs. Pass the returned configuration object to `PKAddPaymentPassViewController`'s `initWithRequestConfiguration:delegate:` initializer.
 
 @param name Your cardholder's name. Example: John Appleseed
 @param description A localized description of your card's name. This will appear in Apple's UI as "{description} will be available in Wallet". Example: Platinum Rewards Card
 @param last4 The last 4 of the card to be added to the user's Apple Pay wallet. Example: 4242
 @param brand The brand of the card. Example: `STPCardBrandVisa`
