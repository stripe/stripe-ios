/**
 Typically, you will not need to implement this protocol yourself. You
 should instead use `STPCustomerContext`, which implements <STPBackendAPIAdapter>
 and manages retrieving and updating a Stripe customer for you.
 @see STPCustomerContext.h

 If you would prefer retrieving and updating your Stripe customer object via
 your own backend instead of using `STPCustomerContext`, you should make your 
 application's API client conform to this interface. It provides a "bridge" from 
 the prebuilt UI we expose (such as `STPPaymentOptionsViewController`) to your
 backend to fetch the information it needs to power those views.
