/**
 An object representing parameters to confirm a SetupIntent object.
 
 For example, you would confirm a SetupIntent when a customer hits the “Save” button on a payment method management view in your app.
 
 If the selected payment method does not require any additional steps from the customer, the SetupIntent's status will transition to `STPSetupIntentStatusSucceeded`.  Otherwise, it will transition to `STPSetupIntentStatusRequiresAction`, and suggest additional actions via `nextAction`.
 Instead of passing this to `[STPAPIClient confirmSetupIntent...]` directly, we recommend using `STPPaymentHandler` to handle any additional steps for you.
