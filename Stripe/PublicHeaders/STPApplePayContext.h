/**
 A helper class that implements Apple Pay.
 
 Usage looks like this:
 1. Initialize this class with a PKPaymentRequest describing the payment request (amount, line items, required shipping info, etc)
 2. Call presentApplePayOnViewController:completion: to present the Apple Pay sheet and begin the payment process
 3 (optional): If you need to respond to the user changing their shipping information/shipping method, implement the optional delegate methods
 4. When the user taps 'Buy', this class uses the PaymentIntent that you supply in the applePayContext:didCreatePaymentMethod:completion: delegate method to complete the payment
 5. After payment completes/errors and the sheet is dismissed, this class informs you in the applePayContext:didCompleteWithStatus: delegate method
