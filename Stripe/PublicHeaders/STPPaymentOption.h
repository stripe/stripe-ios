 This protocol represents a payment method that a user can select and use to 
 pay.
 
 The classes that conform to it and are supported by the UI:
 
 - `STPApplePay`, which represents that the user wants to pay with
 Apple Pay
 - `STPPaymentMethod`.  Only `STPPaymentMethod.type == STPPaymentMethodTypeCard` and
`STPPaymentMethod.type == STPPaymentMethodTypeFPX` are supported by `STPPaymentContext`
 and `STPPaymentOptionsViewController`
 - `STPPaymentMethodParams`. This should be used with non-reusable payment method, such
 as FPX and iDEAL. Instead of reaching out to Stripe to create a PaymentMethod, you can
 pass an STPPaymentMethodParams directly to Stripe when confirming a PaymentIntent.

 @note card-based Sources, Cards, and FPX support this protocol for use
 in a custom integration.
