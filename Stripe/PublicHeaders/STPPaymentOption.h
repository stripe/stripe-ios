 This protocol represents a payment method that a user can select and use to 
 pay. Currently the only classes that conform to it are `STPCard`, which
 represents that the user wants to pay with a specific card,
 `STPApplePay`, which represents that the user wants to pay with
 Apple Pay, and `STPSource`. Only `STPSource.type == STPSourceTypeCard` payment
 methods are supported by `STPPaymentContext` and `STPPaymentOptionsViewController`,
 but the other types do have basic support for this protocol for use in a custom
 integration.
