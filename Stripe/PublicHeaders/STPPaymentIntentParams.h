 An object representing parameters used to confirm a PaymentIntent object.

 A PaymentIntent must have a PaymentMethod or Source associated in order to successfully confirm it.

 That PaymentMethod or Source can either be:

 - created during confirmation, by passing in a `STPPaymentMethodParams` or `STPSourceParams` object in the `paymentMethodParams` or `sourceParams` field
 - a pre-existing PaymentMethod or Source can be associated by passing its id in the `paymentMethodId` or `sourceId` field
 - or already set via your backend, either when creating or updating the PaymentIntent
