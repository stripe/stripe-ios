/**
This class is a piece of fake UI that is intended to mimic `PKAddPaymentPassViewController`. That class is restricted to apps with a special entitlement from Apple, and as such can be difficult to build and test against. This class implements the same public API as `PKAddPaymentPassViewController`, and can be used to develop against the Stripe API in *testmode only*. (Obviously it will not actually place cards into the user's Apple Pay wallet either.) When it's time to go to production, you may simply replace all references to `STPFakeAddPaymentPassViewController` in your app with `PKAddPaymentPassViewController` and it will continue to function. For more information on developing against this API, please see https://stripe.com/docs/issuing/cards/digital-wallets .
