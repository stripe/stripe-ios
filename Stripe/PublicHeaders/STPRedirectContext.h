/**
 This is a helper class for handling redirects associated with STPSource and
 STPPaymentIntents.

 Init and retain an instance with the Source or PaymentIntent you want to handle,
 then choose a redirect method. The context will fire the completion handler
 when the redirect completes.

 Due to the nature of iOS, very little concrete information can be gained
 during this process, as all actions take place in either the Safari app
 or the sandboxed SFSafariViewController class. The context attempts to 
 detect when the user has completed the necessary redirect action by listening
 for both app foregrounds and url callbacks received in the app delegate.
 However, it is possible the when the redirect is "completed", the user may
 have not actually completed the necessary actions to authorize the charge.

 You should not use either this class, nor `STPAPIClient`, as a way
 to determine when you should charge the Source or to determine if the redirect
 was successful. Use Stripe webhooks on your backend server to listen for Source
 state changes and to make the charge.

 device, this call will do a direct app-to-app redirect instead of showing
 a web url.
