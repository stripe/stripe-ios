 This view controller presents a list of payment method options to the user, 
 which they can select between. They can also add credit cards to the list. 
 
 It must be displayed inside a `UINavigationController`, so you can either 
 create a `UINavigationController` with an `STPPaymentOptionsViewController` 
 as the `rootViewController` and then present the `UINavigationController`, 
 or push a new `STPPaymentOptionsViewController` onto an existing 
 `UINavigationController`'s stack. You can also have `STPPaymentContext` do this
 for you automatically, by calling `presentPaymentOptionsViewController` 
 or `pushPaymentOptionsViewController` on it.
