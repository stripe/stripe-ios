 * An SWHttpTrafficRecorder lets you intercepts the http requests made by an application and records their responses in a specified format. There are three built-in formats supported: ResponseBodyOnly, Mocktail and HTTPMessage. These formats are widely used by various mocking/stubbing frameworks such as Mocktail(https://github.com/puls/objc-mocktail), OHHTTPStubs(https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs/tree/master/OHHTTPStubs), Nocilla(https://github.com/luisobo/Nocilla), etc. You can also use it to monitor the traffic for debugging purpose.
