/// This protocol represents a payment method that a user can select and use to
/// pay.
/// The classes that conform to it and are supported by the UI:
/// - `STPApplePay`, which represents that the user wants to pay with
/// Apple Pay
/// - `STPPaymentMethod`.  Only `STPPaymentMethod.type == STPPaymentMethodTypeCard` and
/// `STPPaymentMethod.type == STPPaymentMethodTypeFPX` are supported by `STPPaymentContext`
/// and `STPPaymentOptionsViewController`
/// - `STPPaymentMethodParams`. This should be used with non-reusable payment method, such
/// as FPX and iDEAL. Instead of reaching out to Stripe to create a PaymentMethod, you can
/// pass an STPPaymentMethodParams directly to Stripe when confirming a PaymentIntent.
/// @note card-based Sources, Cards, and FPX support this protocol for use
/// in a custom integration.
