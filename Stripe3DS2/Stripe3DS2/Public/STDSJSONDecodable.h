 Initializes an instance of the class from its JSON representation.
 
 This method recognizes two categories of errors:
 - a required field is missing.
 - a required field value is in valid (e.g. expected 'Y' or 'N' but received 'X').
 
 Errors populating optional fields are ignored.

 @param outError If there was a missing required field or invalid field value, contains an instance of NSError.
 
 @return The object represented by the JSON dictionary.  If the object could not be decoded, returns nil and populates the outError argument.
