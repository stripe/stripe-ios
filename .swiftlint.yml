# .swiftlint.yml
#
# Goals:
#   - Decrease number of `disabled_rules` that we agree with as a team
#   - Increase number of `opt_in_rules` that we agree with as a team
#   - Increase number of `custom_rules` that we agree with as a team
#   - Avoid rule customization unless increasing strictness that we agree with as a team
#
# Useful rules reference: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/master/Rules.md
