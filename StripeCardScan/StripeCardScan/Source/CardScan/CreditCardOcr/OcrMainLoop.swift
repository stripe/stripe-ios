/// This is the main loop for OCR. It runs one of our OCR systems in paralell with the Apple OCR system and
/// combines results. From a high level this implements a standard producer-consumer where the main
/// system will push images and ROI rectangles into the main loop and two Analyzers, or OCR systems
/// will consume the images.
///
/// The producer, which pushes images will keep N (2 currently) images in the queue and when a new image
/// comes in it will remove old images leaving the N most recent images. That way we can try to get more
/// diversity in images by virtue of maximizing the time in between images that it reads.
///
/// The consumers pull images from the queue and run the full OCR algorithm, including expiry extraction and
/// full error correction on the combined results.
///
/// In terms of iOS abstractions, we make heavy use of dispatch queues. We have a single `mutexQueue`
/// that we use to mutate our shared state. This queue is a serial queue and our method for synchronizing
/// access. One thing to be careful with is we use `sync` in places to access our `mutexQueue`. This
/// method can lead to deadlock if you aren't careful.
///
/// # Correcness criteria
/// We make heavy use of dispatch queues for paralellism, so it's important to be disciplined about how
/// we access shared state
///
/// ## Shared state
/// All shared state updates need to happeon on the `mutexQueue` except for `machineLearningQueue`,
/// which we set at the constructor and access it read only.
///
/// ## Delegate invocation
/// All invocations of delegate methods need to happen on the main queue, and for each prediction there
/// are one or more methods that may get called in order:
/// - `prediction` this happens on all predictions
/// - if the scan predicts a number, then `showCardDetails` happens with the current overall predicted number, expiry, and name
/// - if the scan is complete, then `complete` includes the final result
///
/// To finalize results, we clear out the `mainLoopDelegate` after it's done
///
/// It's important that we not update `scanStats` after complete is called or call any futher delegate functions, although
/// more predictions might come through after the fact
///
/// We also expose `shouldUsePrediction` that delegates can implement to discard a prediction, but note that the `prediction`
/// method still fires even when this returns false. Note: `shouldUsePrediction` is called from the `mutexQueue` so handlers
/// don't need to synchronize but they may need to handle any computation that needs to happen on the main loop appropriately.
///
/// ## userCancelled
/// One aspect to be careful with when someone invokes the `userCancelled` method is that there could be a race with OCR and it
/// could complete OCR in parallel with this call. The net result we want is if a caller calls this method we don't subsequenty fire any of
/// the `OcrMainLoopDelegate` methods and we want to make sure that `scanStats.success` is always `false` to correctly
/// denote that this scan failed.
///
/// To handle this correctly we:
/// - use the `userDidCancel` variable here and in any of our blocks that run on the main dispatch queue. Since this call should
/// come from the main dispatch queue, those calls, where we invoke the callback methods, will run after this one and we prevent firing
/// their delegate methods.
/// - the logic to set `scanStats.success` will come on the `muxtexQueue`, but could execute either before or after this block runs.
///    - If it's before then this block will overwrite the `success` results with the unsuccessful result here. If the
///    - If it runs after, there is a check and it sets `scanStats.success` iff it isn't already set
/// - we use `sync` on the `muxtexQueue` to make sure that when this method returns any subsequent calls to `scanStats` are
/// always `success = false`
///
/// ## backgrounding
/// We track when the app is in the active state and stop accepting images when it's inactive. When it becomes active we reset
/// the `errorCorrection` state before re-enabling computation.
///
/// This backgrounding logic is less about correctness and more about making sure that the SDK doesn't send the caller predictions
/// at unexpected times by making sure that the app is active if and when it sends notifications of success.
